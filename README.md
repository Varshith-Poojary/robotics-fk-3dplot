# Forward Kinematics of a 4-DOF Robot Arm  

This project implements **forward kinematics** for a simple 4-DOF robotic arm using Python and NumPy.  
It calculates the transformation matrices of each joint and visualizes the arm in **3D** with Matplotlib.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Computes cumulative transformation matrices (Denavitâ€“Hartenberg style)  
- Plots the robotic arm in 3D space  
- Highlights **base** (red) and **end effector** (blue)  
- Takes user input for joint angles and link lengths  

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements  
Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
